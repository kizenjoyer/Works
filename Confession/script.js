At first, I thought we we're just messing around, but as we started playing together more and playing with just the two of us, I started to have feelings for you. Every time we play, or even just talk, I find myself smiling, feeling this strange warmth inside, like butterflies in my stomach. Itâ€™s like my day gets better whenever Iâ€™m with you, and I look forward to spending each day with you. And donâ€™t get me started on your voice. The way you call my name? It seriously makes me blush every time (,,> á´— <,,). I always miss you, but when weâ€™re not talking or playing, I catch myself missing you more. Itâ€™s like thereâ€™s a part of my day thatâ€™s incomplete without you in it. Whenever youâ€™re out or at school, I find myself thinking about you. I really love spending time with you, even if youâ€™re doing something like your homework. And the way you tease me? Itâ€™s another reason why I enjoy being around you so much. Since we met, Iâ€™ve started to feel closer to you, remembering all these little details about you, like your favorite color, and I find myself wanting to know more.

I want to spend more time with you, get to know you better, and see where this thing we have goes. You mean a lot to me, Keziah, and I want you to know that <3</span>`;
